 - IPv6 has not yet been through the same refactoring and improvements as the IPv4 model
   after that, xMIPv6 needs to be tested and revised as well

 - 802.11 statistics, logging, display strings
 - 802.11 preamble, header, data separation in HT and VHT mode doesn't really make sense the way it's right now implemented
   there's no separate header in these modes, the preamble is much more complicated than in the other modes
   there's also a bug related to this in the Ieee80211ScalarTransmitter when it computes the data duration
 - add separate Ieee80211Socket
 - Ieee80211Mac to fire TxNotifDetails when Ack arrives for a frame. Mgmt layer
   to use this notification to learn when ProbeRequest or AssociationResponse
   has been transmitted.

 - reduce redundancy among applications, e.g. add base application with parameterizable IO submodule, perhaps even create an IO base module which uses the ISocket interface

 - add examples/documentation for matching PCP value and destination MAC address for outgoing packets (identification)
 - example with Pcp and PriorityToTrafficClassClassifier classifier example

 - come up with realistic frame replication showcases such as multiple link breaks which still produce the traffic at the destination
 - add examples to flow measurements for store-and-forward, A-MPDU aggregation, preemption, cut-through and their effects on the bit and packet total times

 - implement multicast support in one gate scheduling configurator

 - compound figures should be updated to have a bounds property that contains all elements and they must not be over-determined (e.g. size vs plotSize) see topic/figures

 - ThruputMeteringChannel -> result filter + visualizer for measuring the channel throughput using channel signals and result for analysis

 - handlePullPacketChanged can come from the queue when
   - a high priority frame is already being streamed and it gets interrupted
   - a low priority frame cannot be interrupted because it's already too close to its end (remaining minPacketLength)
   - in both cases a progress report is sent which is unnecessary and confusing

 - create release script (remove trailing spaces, replace leading tabs, fix header guards, format source code)

 - add parameters to ScenarioManager disconnect operation to allow cutting connection at either end (source or destination)
   and also support disconnecting bidirectional connections in all four combinations.

 - implement additional INET specific fingerprint ingredients: network interface configuration, routing table, mobility state, etc.
 - extend timeGains/frequencyGains parsing with OMNeT++ 6.0 expression parser support (#ifdef)
 - extend Units with double and simtime_t handling and use C++ units in division and multiplication functions

 - implement MemoizedFunction and multi dimensional domain subdivision tree
 - add parameter for orthogonal combinator function: multiplicative and minimum based

 - the packet dissector may need to do implicit chunk conversion because it has to choose a representation which may or may not be the same as the one in the packet (e.g. two interoperable frameworks)

 - change all protocols (where applicable) to accept any kind of cPacket (not only Packet) for interoperability with 3rd party projects 
 - remove obsolete HostAutoConfigurator, Ipv4FlatNetworkConfigurator modules?
 - solve dynamic node creation and address resolution in applications
 - don't subclass APSK medium and such with other specific radios, think of APSK radio as yet another specific conceptual radio
 - move extra functions that doesn't really belong to L3AddressResolver (e.g. findInterfaceTableOf, findIPv4RoutingTableOf)
 - use m instead of double in Coord?
 - replace functionality of GenericAppMsg with chunk tags, or better yet get rid of it altogether!
 - review all examples and check if they still do what is intended
 - add separate reusable application packet generators
 - rewrite serializers that use structure bit fields, this is undefined C++ behavior

 - replace cCompoundModule class in hosts/nodes with a specific classes such as StandardHost
   providing getInterfaceTable, getMobility, getIPv4NetworkLayer, etc. to avoid random code fragments with getSubmodule(".ipv4.routingTable")???
   but we should avoid having these classes for a random collections of utility functions!
 - add separate classes/functions for iterating over the network nodes in a network or
   finding a network node based on its mac address/ip address or finding the position of a network node, etc.
 - add missing node NED files for existing protocols (e.g. sensor nodes, IoT devices) 

 - @descriptor(false) vs @descriptor(readonly); why do we have descriptor anything at all? why don't we have descriptors for all types all the time?
 - @editable(false) vs @descriptor(readonly)??? and in general editable is a GUI concept

 - DYMOSequenceNumber: class DYMOSequenceNumber??? why class? primitive class???
 - PacketDrop: packet_ -> packet
 - InterfaceEntry: eliminate @getter if possible
 - EtherType.msg: replace with Protocol.h?
 - IPProtocolId.msg: replace with Protocol.h?

 - review and refactor all applications which have lifecycle, startTime, endTime parameters, move code from initialize to separate reusable functions (e.g. for lifecycle restart)

 - DHCP Client/Server should work with multiple interfaces

 - examples/ospfv2/areas does not work: the UDP apps in H3 keep sending, but never receive answer; seems like
   sent packets cannot even leave H3 (they are queued up in ARP, due to "address resolution pending")

 - provide default for RoutingTable.routingTableFile once xmlinline() is implemented in omnet.

 - gate labeling for the NED editor
 - change the @labels(PPPFrame) label on pppg[] gates of hosts/routers to something slightly different
   (e.g. @labels(PPPFrame/pk)) so that PPPInterface does not appear in the palette on network level?

 - review if existing (also add missing) "q=queue" display string tags still refer to the right module?
 - rename TCPBasicClientApp to TCPRequestReplyClientApp?

 - rename the following TED.h methods to begin with a verb:
   - unsigned int linkIndex(IPAddress advrouter, IPAddress linkid)
   - unsigned int linkIndex(IPAddress localInf)
   - IPAddress peerRemoteInterface(IPAddress peerIP)
   - IPAddress primaryAddress(IPAddress localInf)

 - model link failures, via isDown() method of InterfaceEntry. L2 modules
   should understand isDown(), and FailureManager should be enhanced with
   linkdown/linkup commands. See email on list archive on 9/17/2006 10:34 AM

 - problem with NetworkConfigurator + RSVP's FailureManager: after deleting/recreating
   LSR, configured IP addresses and host routes to PPP peers get lost.
   Solution: implement failure/recovery with NF_FAILURE and NF_RECOVERY notifications!

 - "ack" in LinkStateMsg redundant? (never read)
   what is the TELinkInfo.state flag?
   what is UnResvBandwidth[8] indexed with? what is [4] and [7] that gets printed?

 - reading routing files: it doesn't make sense to be able to manually set MULTICAST on an interface

 - apps: add startTime param; IPAddressResolver should only be invoked at startTime not in initialize()!

 - MPLS/LDP/RSVP:
    - document! ScenarioManager commands, XML file formats, unimplemented features

 - generic
   - add meaningful display strings to at least the top level submodules of network nodes (with optional formatting parameters)
   - cache gate IDs to speed up sending
   - revise protocol base class hierarchy (e.g. LayeredProtocolBase vs IPv4 base class, etc.)
   - revise protocol header class hierarchy (e.g. avoid unnecessary interfaces)
   - revise NED network node module hierarchy (e.g. MPLS nodes)
   - nicely position submodules in compound modules, prepare for 2 info lines
   - avoid specifying module icon sizes by default, override icon size in submodules

 - cleanup
   - review all examples to check if they still work as expected
   - rename all modules, parameters, classes, signals, statistics, labels to have a consistent naming scheme
   - discuss renaming *Layered* modules to *Compound* or *Modular*?
   - if conditional connections are used, eliminate typename != "" from NED files using default interface ommitted typenames
   - unify C++ namespaces, NED namespaces, folders and file names
   - eliminate C style casts, especially after (Foo*)foo->dup()
   - update all EV statements to use EV_FIELD
   - replace cross module pointers with ModuleRef<T>
   - bitrate vs datarate
   - operator<<, printOn, str, etc. in all classes

 - porting
   - simuLTE PHY full support and porting to INET 4.x
   - help ANSA porting to INET 4.x
